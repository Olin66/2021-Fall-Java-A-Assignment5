# 2021-Fall-Java-A-Assignment5
The **Assignment 5** for course ***Introduction to Computer Programming A (CS102A)*** in 2021 Fall at Southern University of Science and Technology.  
This assignment was done to help others, the code has passed all the test cases on both Local Judge and Online Judge.  
I have finished the following classes: *SearchPlan*, *SustechTime*, *Flight*, *Airline*, *SustechAirline*, and *Search*. For the *Search* class, there are three subclasses extended from the Search class, but I only implement the *DirectSearch* class and the *TransitOnceSearch* class. The UnlimitedSearch is a bonus.

The description for this assigment is in [CS102A-FALL-A5.pdf](https://github.com/Olin66/2021-Fall-Java-A-Assignment5/blob/master/CS102A-FALL-A5.pdf). The teacher provided a zip file [toStudent.zip](https://github.com/Olin66/2021-Fall-Java-A-Assignment5/blob/master/toStudent.zip), there are several files in this zip file. Theses files contain the original classes needed to be completed, some Junit codes for test the correctness of the codes in Local Judge and some test cases for testing.
